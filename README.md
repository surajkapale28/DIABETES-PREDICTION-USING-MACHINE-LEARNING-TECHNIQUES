This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients using machine learning techniques. 
Technologies:
  Machine Learning: The code demonstrates a simple machine learning pipeline for predicting diabetes.
  Support Vector Machine (SVM): Specifically, the SVC class from scikit-learn is used with a linear kernel for classification.
  Data Preprocessing: Techniques like handling missing values (replacing zeros with NaN and then filling NaNs with the mean) are employed.
  Model Deployment: The trained model is serialized using pickle and saved to a file (model.pkl) for future use.
